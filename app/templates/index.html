          <h2>What is this?</h2>
          <p>
            This christmas I am giving the masses control of my christmas tree lights. This page is the endpoint from
            which the lights can be controlled. It contains a real-time image of what the tree is looking like right now
            along with some controls for changing the LED arrangement and colors.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any interaction you have with the page here is forwarded down to the christmas tree and you can watch as
            your commands battle those of other users online right now.

          <h2>How is it made?</h2>
          <p>
            A <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> sitting on my desk is connected to a webcam and a
            custom dongle I built that controls a string of 50
            <a href="https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/WS2811.pdf">WS2811</a> individually-addressable LEDs.
            That Raspberry Pi then SSH's into my cloud server and connects to a <a href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a>
            instance hosted there. A <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/">Flask</a>-based python application on
            the cloud server connects to the same redis instance and uses the PUBSUB functionality to receive the
            realtime webcam image published by the Raspberry Pi and also issue commands back to the Raspberry Pi.
            <a href="https://socket.io/">Socketio</a> is used to communicate between this (static) page and the python
            app running on the server.
